# Kitchen Leftover
A web application built using MERN Stack which helps user search for recipes using either their ingredient or the name. 
Users can also signup/login  and keep track of ther kitchen ingredients by adding them to the list. The search is done using the [Recipe Puppy Api] (http://www.recipepuppy.com/about/api/).
